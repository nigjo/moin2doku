Complete MoinMoin to DokuWiki converter
=======================================

Uses native MoinMoin modules to handle converting and translating paths.
Converts also page history and edit-log.

http://www.dokuwiki.org/tips:moinmoin2doku

Tested with MoinMoin 1.9.9 and DokuWiki 2018-04-22 releases under Windows 7

You need to run this on host where both MoinMoin and DokuWiki are configured,
it uses current configuration from both wikis.

Edit `doku.php` if your DokuWiki installation is other than `/usr/share/dokuwiki`

To convert moinmoin all pages with history, invoke:
```
$ ./moin2doku.py -a -d /var/lib/dokuwiki
```

To convert single page (FrontPage):
```
$ ./moin2doku.py -F moinmoin/data/pages/FrontPage -d out
```

You should invoke `bin/indexer.php` after conversion to make all pages are indexed.

and ensure ownership of files is correct:
(`www-data:www-data` being your uid/gid webserver runs):
```
# chown -R www-data:www-data /var/lib/dokuwiki/pages/*
# chown -R www-data:www-data /var/lib/dokuwiki/media/*
```
additionally, depending on your configuration, you may need to gzip the attic pages.


Hints for Windows Users
-----------------------

The Batchfiles (`*.cmd`) should help to do the conversation under Windows. You should
create a copy of the `settings.cmd` and call it `settings.local.cmd` to set your
own local paths.

Call `moin2doku.cmd` to convert the full MoinMoin Wiki. All DokuWiki pages will be
written to an `out` folder in the current directory.

This will convert a single page:
```
D:\moin2doku\> moin2doku.cmd MyMoinPage
```

Set `%OUTDIR%` to an alternativ output folder. This should not be the dokuwiki `data`
folder if you want to do a full conversation.

The `reindex.cmd` will call the `bin/indexer.php`-Skript.

Complete moinmoin to dokuwiki converter, uses native moinmoin code to handle

This marks the project "done", I will no longer develop it or support it, as I got my conversion done. However, I do accept patches (pull requests) to sane amount.

I put repo online so others have better starting point than I did.

----------------
Modifed the script to work with newer Moin versions and API changes.


version 1.2 (2019-01)
----------------
Some modifications to work with current DokuWiki and added more formattings.
